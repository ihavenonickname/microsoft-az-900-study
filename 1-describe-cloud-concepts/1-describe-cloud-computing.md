# Describe cloud computing

## What is cloud computing

Cloud computing is the online delivery of computing services, including IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking. It also extends to advanced technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI).

Unlike traditional datacenters, cloud computing is not restricted by physical infrastructure, allowing for rapid scalability and flexibility. Organizations can expand their IT resources instantly without the need for building new physical infrastructure.

## Describe the shared responsibility model

The shared responsibility model defines how responsibilities are divided between the cloud provider and the consumer.

In a traditional datacenter, the company handles everything—physical security, infrastructure maintenance, software updates, and data management.

With cloud computing, these responsibilities are shared:

- Cloud provider manages physical security, power, cooling, and network connectivity.
- Consumer is responsible for data security, access control, and certain infrastructure configurations.
- Some responsibilities vary based on the service type:
    - **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Consumer has more responsibility.
    - **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Responsibilities are more balanced.
    - **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Cloud provider handles most responsibilities.

The shared responsibility model ensures security and efficiency while leveraging cloud services.

## Define cloud models

Cloud models define how cloud resources are deployed. The three main types are:

- **Private Cloud**: Used by a single organization, offering greater control but at a higher cost. It can be hosted on-site or in a dedicated offsite datacenter.
- **Public Cloud**: Managed by a third-party provider and open to anyone who purchases services. It offers scalability and cost savings.
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combines private and public clouds, allowing flexibility, scalability, and enhanced security by distributing workloads between environments.

## Describe the consumption-based model

IT expenses fall into two categories: Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx).

- **CapEx**: Involves one-time, upfront costs for tangible assets like buildings, datacenters, or company vehicles.
- **OpEx**: Covers ongoing expenses for services and products, such as leasing equipment or cloud computing.

Cloud computing is an OpEx model because it operates on a pay-as-you-go basis—you only pay for the resources you use, with no upfront costs. This model offers benefits like scalability, flexibility, and cost efficiency. Unlike traditional datacenters, where resource planning can lead to wasted capacity or shortages, the cloud allows you to scale up or down instantly based on demand.

## Compare cloud pricing models

Cloud computing delivers computing services over the internet using a pay-as-you-go model. You only pay for what you use, helping you manage costs, improve efficiency, and scale as needed.

Instead of maintaining hardware in your own datacenter, you rent compute power and storage from a cloud provider. When you're done, you return the resources and stop paying for them. The provider handles infrastructure maintenance, allowing you to focus on solving business challenges and delivering innovative solutions.
