# Describe cloud service types

## Describe Infrastructure as a Service

IaaS offers the most flexibility in cloud services, providing maximum control over your cloud resources. The cloud provider manages hardware, network connectivity, and physical security, while you handle the operating system, configurations, databases, and security. Essentially, you're renting hardware in the cloud to use as you see fit.

In the shared responsibility model, the cloud provider handles physical infrastructure, and you are responsible for configurations, updates, and security.

Common IaaS Scenarios:

- Lift-and-shift migration: Moving on-prem resources to the cloud while maintaining the same setup.
- Testing and development: Quickly replicating environments for development or testing while retaining full control.

## Describe Platform as a Service

PaaS provides a balance between IaaS and SaaS, offering a complete development environment while abstracting infrastructure management. The cloud provider manages physical infrastructure, security, operating systems, middleware, and development tools. This allows you to focus on building and deploying applications without worrying about OS licensing or patches.

In the shared responsibility model, the cloud provider handles most of the infrastructure and services, while you manage networking, application security, and configuration.

Common PaaS Scenarios:

- Development framework: Provides tools and frameworks for developers to build and customize cloud-based applications with built-in features like scalability and high availability.
- Analytics and business intelligence: PaaS offers services to analyze data, uncover insights, and make better business decisions.

## Describe Software as a Service

SaaS is the most complete cloud service model, offering fully developed applications like email, financial software, and messaging apps. While less flexible, it is the easiest to implement, requiring minimal technical expertise.

In the shared responsibility model, SaaS places most responsibilities on the cloud provider, including infrastructure, security, and app maintenance. The user is mainly responsible for data, device access, and user permissions.

Common SaaS Scenarios:

- Email and messaging.
- Business productivity applications.
- Finance and expense tracking.
